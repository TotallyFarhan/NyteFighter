          <h3>The Lives PowerUp</h3>
          <p>
            The Lives PowerUp is the blue circle with the heart. When you pick
            up this PowerUp, you get an extra life. It's useful when you're
            close to running out of lives and need something to help you get
            back up. At a time, you only get one life. Not as useful as the
            immunity, but still worth your time! It has a 33% chance of
            spawning.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="immunity">
          <h3>The Immunity PowerUp</h3>
          <p>
            The Immunity PowerUp is the orange circle with the sheid. This
            PowerUp grants you immunity, meaning you cannot die from touching an
            enemy. Immunity is represented with a white border around the
            player. If an enemy touches you with the immunity shield, they
            immediately die and your immunity shield goes away, making you
            invulnerable again. It has a 16% chance of spawning.
          </p>
        </div>
        <br />
        <div id="speed">
          <h3>The Speed PowerUp</h3>
          <p>
            The Speed PowerUp is the purple circle with the lightning bold. This
            PowerUp gives you a speed boost on your player, which lasts
            approximately 8 to 9 seconds. Pretty useful when trying to kill
            enemies that are far apart from each other, and you need to get to
            them quickly. It has a 10% chance of spawning.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div id="wall">
          <h3>The Wall PowerUp</h3>
          <p>
            The Wall PowerUp is the light-blue circle with the hammer. This
            PowerUp builds you a wall behind you, causing enemies to not be able
            to go behind you. This means that when an enemy goes behind you,
            instead of losing a life, it hits the wall and dies, which removes
            health from the wall. The wall stays up until it breaks, which takes
            9 enemies to break. It has a 5% chance of spawning.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div id="power">
          <h3>The Damage PowerUp</h3>
          <p>
            The Damage PowerUp is the red circle with the muscle. This PowerUp
            coats your bullets in a shining red armor, which makes them stronger
            and the enemies easier to kill. The regular enemy is now one-shot,
            the Tank enemy takes 5 shots, and the Speed enemy is also one-shot.
            The Boss Battle also is affected by the Damage PowerUp (subject to
            change). This PowerUp has a 20% chance of spawning.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="slow">
          <h3>The Slowness PowerUp</h3>
          <p>
            The Slowness PowerUp is the pink circle with the snowflake. This
            PowerUp causes the enemies to move at a slower pace, exactly half
            thier normal speed. This PowerUp lasts for about 5 seconds, which
            can allow you to calm down if enemies have been attacking you at a
            rapid rate for a while. This PowerUp is effective even during the
            Boss Battle, so the enemies that do spawn during the boss battle are
            slowed. This has a 14% chance of spawning.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="ally">
          <h3>The Ally PowerUp</h3>
          <p>
            The Ally PowerUp is the brown circle with the robot. This PowerUp
            allows for you to spawn in a helper robot called an ally to right
            the enemies with you. Each ally can take three hits from an enemy
            until it despawns. They shoot at a slow rate, and spawn in a random
            place on left side of the screen. You can only have two allies once,
            and once one dies, you have the chance for another one to spawn in.
            This has a 20% chance of spawning, every ten seconds while you have
            less than two allies. There will eventually be ally specific
            powerups, soon to come!

        <div class="info">
          <p>
            The Boss Battle begins when you reach 100 or more points. It takes
            130 bullets to kill the boss (changes based on Damage Multiplier).
            It has an outer shell that acts as a shield. During the boss battle,
            only the regular green enemies will spawn. You need to shoot the
            boss and the enemies at the same time. The boss's outer shell can
            take 100 hits before breaking. When the shield breaks, the boss is
            left vulnerable. This causes the regular green enemies to move
            faster, so they can defeat the player. It takes 30 hits after the
            shield breaks to kill the boss. After the boss is defeated, the game
            will resume like normal.
